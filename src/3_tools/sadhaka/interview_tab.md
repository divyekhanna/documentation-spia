# Interview Tab

In the existing process, the Interview Tab in Sadhaka streamlines the management of video calls, applicant reviews, and post-video call activities. It provides comprehensive details about the applicant, integrating information from all application forms, video call feedback, and decisions made to offer a detailed view of the applicant’s profile.

## Interviewer, Reviewer & Appointment details:
This section gives an understanding about who took the interview, who reviewed the application and what were the decisions made. It also highlights the Appointment and some Follow-up details.

## Interviewer Feedback
Once the video call is complete, the video caller records constructive feedback from the video caller for a transparent and fair decision-making process in this section.

The feedback section has various fields and dropdown options to capture all essential information.

This section also highlights the [SDP Status](./sdp_review.md) (Please refer to the 'Call Details' section) and SDP comments may be added by the previous year's application reviewer to highlight any specific points that need to be checked during the audio or video call.

## Comments
In some cases, follow-ups are necessary after the video call, such as obtaining parent/spouse consent, completing mandala, or correcting practices. If the applicant has previous volunteering experience, feedback from other departments should also be collected.

This section captures the information required from the applicant after the video call and any follow-up actions needed. Additionally, it captures all communications between the interviewer, reviewer and the "Post VC" team, including follow-up interactions with the applicant.
