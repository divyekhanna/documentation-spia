# SDP Review

Once the participant submits the interest form via the Sadhanapada Website, the application goes to SDP review stage, where it is screened for potential duplication and general readyness to flow in the application process. The following SDP tags are used to mark the applications:

1. Blank or Approved - Can go ahead with the application
2. Yet to review - Review is not yet done. Add it in Help Desk
3. Duplicate - Applied twice in the same year, so an application will be marked as Duplicate
4. Rejected - Application is reviewed and tagged as Rejected. Do not go ahead with the application
5. In-Correct - Two applicants applied with the same contact details. Check the SDP comments
6. Review not required - Previous years applicant (covid times), VC is done and approved, but couldn’t
come for the program due to travel restrictions.
7. Allow after Volunteering - All Trail is a Must applicants who couldn’t come for trail in previous years
will fall under this bucket.
