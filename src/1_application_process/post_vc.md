# Chapter 5 - Post Video Call Support

## Purpose

The Post Video Call Support team plays a crucial role in assisting applicants after they complete the video call stage of the application process. Their objectives include:
* Offering ongoing support with the application process until the applicant is approved for the program.
* Serving as a single point of contact, eliminating the need for applicants to interact with multiple volunteers and ensuring clear communication.
* Understanding each applicant's unique needs and providing personalized assistance on a case-by-case basis.

## People 
The Post Video Call Support team follows the below structure: 
* The Video Callers and Post-VC Support team are organized based on the languages they speak.
* Each member of the Post-VC Support team will be assigned to approximately five Video Callers (taking care of all the applicants they engage with), ensuring a language match between the two.

## Process Overview
* Start: The process starts once the video call is completed and the video caller has recorded the feedback and opinion on Sadhaka
* End: The process ends when the applicant gets approved for the program

## Data & Tooling
For the purpose of carrying out the specific routine tasks for this process, an AppSheet called "Reminder Call Queues" is being used. Data is imported from Sadhaka into this AppSheet by the AppSheet maintainer. From there, the post VC team can carry out their [routine tasks](./post_vc/routine_tasks.md).
