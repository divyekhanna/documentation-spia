# Post VC Routine Tasks

## 1. Calling the applicant

The calls will be made from a dedicated phone number provided to the Post VC team member. The key points to discuss with the applicant:
* Inform the applicant that we will the volunteer they can get in touch with for any queries, concerns regarding their Sadhanapada application and ask them to Save the contact
* Health Assessment Form
    * If the Health Assessment form is not submitted:
        * Request them to submit the form at the earliest.
        * Ask for a tentative time by when they can submit the form
        * Request a confirmation once done
    * If the Health Assessment form is submitted (only when applicant follows up)
        * Check if the Doctor is requesting for more reports and understand a tentative timeline for submission
        * If no reports are pending, inform that the Doctor approval will take up to 2 weeks time
* If Parental/Spouse consent is needed, good time to talk to them
* If practice correction is needed,
    * If they were able to get in touch with an Ishanga and provide an support needed
    * If they have completed the correction, review the practices and ensure the corrections are done
* Intoxicants: Request to leave the intoxicants for a Mandala period
* Mandala: Check if the applicant has started the Mandala, the number of days since the Mandala started
* Irregular with practices: Check if they can restart the practices

All the information gathered from the call should be recorded in the comments for further reference.

## 2. Parent Consent Calls

The parental consent will usually require regional language speaking volunteers.

The key points to check in the call are:
* Does the Parent/Spouse know about the participantâ€™s application for the  Sadhanapada program
* The duration of the program will be 7-8 months and they will not be able to step out for this entire duration [If they ask about emergency situation, respond accordingly]
* Check if there are any financial dependencies
* Any other dependencies which requires their physical presence for this duration
* Any other concern that the video caller updates in the feedback
The parental/spouse consent call should be made at the time confirmed by the applicant and relevant comments have to be updated on Sadhaka.

## 3. Follow-up calls

Based on the earlier conversation with the applicant, relevant follow up calls have to be made and any awaiting information should be closed

## 4. Daily Reviews

Each applicant in the Post VC bucket is reviewed by the coordinator with individual Post VC team member to ensure:
* There are no slip throughs
* If there are any discrepancies to be handled and decisions taken
* If there is any feedback that can be shared with the Video Callers to ensure the process is smooth

## 5. Closing pending information cases

To close any awaiting information pending cases, it is important that all the awaiting information for the applicant are resolved. For example, if the parental consent is taken but the applicant is still having Mandala completion, then we should wait until Mandala completion to add the Awaiting info-closed tag.

* We should remove the Awaiting info-pending tag
* We should close the case by adding the Awaiting info-closed tag in the Application tags
