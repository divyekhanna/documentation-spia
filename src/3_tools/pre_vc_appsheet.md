## Removing record from AppSheet call queue

There are three cases in which you can remove the participant from your call queue:
1. Participant has filled the profile form, watched the video session and filled the reflection form. That is, all follow-ups are complete.
1. After five follow-ups are complete and participant still has pending items, we mark the participant as "No Response" in the AppSheet as well as put applications tag in Sadhaka "PF/SPVideo_No Response".
1. If the participant has cancelled their application, we select mark it as cancelled in the AppSheet
